       <h3>Growth and Volatility of Micropolitan Statistical Areas in the U.S. </h3></a>
            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify"> The objectives of this study are: (1) to describe the geographic distribution, growth, and volatility of the U.S. micropolitan areas during the 1969-2012 period; and (2) to identify and measure the determinants of growth and volatility of micropolitan areas.

       <h3>Industrial Composition, Local Fiscal Policy and Micropolitan Area Economic Growth </h3></a>
            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify"> The influence of fiscal policy variables has been ambiguous depending, for example, on the measure of economic growth used â€“ employment, population, firm growth, etc. It finds that local and state fiscal policies, industrial composition, distance, and human capital have significant impacts on personal income growth in micropolitan areas.

            <p style ="font-family: Arial; font-size:15px; text-align: justify"> This paper examines micropolitan area growth during the 1990s, a period of strong national growth. A spatial equilibrium growth framework and estimated reduced-form regressions containing an extensive number of variables are used to assess the sources of differentials in micropolitan area growth. .
